Predicting Airline Passenger Satisfaction

Using Machine Learning : A Data-Driven Approach to Enhancing Customer Experience

In the competitive airline industry, understanding customer satisfaction is essential for improving service quality and retaining loyal passengers. This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts whether a customer is "Satisfied" or "Neutral/Unhappy" based on various factors including demographic details, travel characteristics, and service-related ratings such as booking ease, inflight service, cleanliness, entertainment, and more. By identifying the key drivers of satisfaction, airlines can take proactive steps to enhance passenger experiences, optimize operations, and make informed, data-driven decisions to improve overall customer engagement.

Business Goal:
Improve overall customer experience by identifying pain points.

Predict customer satisfaction to proactively address service gaps.

Segment customers based on their likelihood of satisfaction for targeted service improvements.
